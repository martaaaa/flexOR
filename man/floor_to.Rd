\title{floor_to: Rounds a number down}
\usage{
floor_to(x, to = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric value or vector that you want to round down or floor.}

\item{to}{the base to which you want to round down the input value(s).
The default value is set to 1, meaning the function will round down to the nearest integer.}
}
\value{
The number rounded down to the specified multiple.
}
\description{
Takes a numeric value or vector (x) and rounds it
down to the nearest multiple of a specified base (to).
If the to argument is not provided, it defaults to rounding down to the nearest integer.
The result is returned as a numeric value or vector of the same length as the input.
}
\examples{
floor_to(7, 3); # Returns 6, as 6 is the largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 7.
floor_to(5, 2); # Returns 4, as 4 is the largest multiple of 2 less than or equal to 5.
