Description: Provides flexible hazard ratio curves allowing non-linear
  relationships between continuous predictors and survival.
  To better understand the effects that each continuous covariate has on the outcome,
  results can be expressed in terms of splines-based odds ratio (OR) curves,
  taking a specific covariate value as reference.
