Description: Provides flexible hazard ratio curves allowing non-linear
  relationships between continuous predictors and survival.
  To better understand the effects that each continuous covariate has on the outcome, results can
  be expressed in terms of splines-based odds ratio (OR) curves, taking a specific
  covariate value as reference.
Depends: R (>= 2.12.0), survival, splines, gam, mlbench
